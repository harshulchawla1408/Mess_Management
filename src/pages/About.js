      <h2>About Hostel Mess Management System</h2>
      <p>
        Our Hostel Mess Management System is designed to streamline meal planning, attendance tracking, and feedback collection 
        for students living in the hostel. This platform offers a convenient way for students to access the weekly menu, 
        check their attendance records, and provide valuable feedback for improving the mess services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system also allows mess administrators to manage and update the menu, monitor attendance, and review feedback, 
        enhancing the overall quality and satisfaction of the mess facilities.
